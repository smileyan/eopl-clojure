Chapter 9. Records

    This chapter describes the means by which the programmer may define new data types, or records types, each distinct from all other types. 
    A record type determines the number and names of the fields each instance of the type has. 
    Records are defined via the define-record-type form or the make-record-type-descriptor procedure.
